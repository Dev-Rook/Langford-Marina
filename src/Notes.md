The vesselâ€™s winch and A-frame can handle a 2.5 tonne lift up to a
height of 3m. The application of slinging and claw mechanisms
will facilitate the lifting of various objects of varying sizes and
configurations. Lifts can be facilitated from a beach or dock side
or from the seafloor. More precise lifting work can be done with
lighter weights using 2 lift bags, each with a maximum lifting
capacity of 0.5 tonnes
